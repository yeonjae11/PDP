Composable Kernel Docker containers
********************************************************************

Docker images that include all the required prerequisites for building Composable Kernel are available on `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/composable_kernel/tags>`_.

The images also contain `ROCm <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/index.html>`_, `CMake <https://cmake.org/getting-started/>`_, and the `ROCm LLVM compiler infrastructure <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/llvm-project/en/latest/index.html>`_.

Composable Kernel Docker images are named according to their operating system and ROCm version. For example, a Docker image named ``ck_ub22.04_rocm6.3`` would correspond to an Ubuntu 22.04 image with ROCm 6.3.
