For C API:
- First, delete all contents of ../../docs/doxygen directory -- that is where the output files go
- In this directory, run "doxygen doxyfile-c"
- The generated output should appear in ../../docs/doxygen

For C++ API:
- First, delete all contents of ../../docs/doxygen-cpp directory -- that is where the output files go
- In this directory, run "doxygen doxyfile-cpp"
- The generated output should appear in ../../docs/doxygen-cpp
